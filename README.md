# Prodject "Calculator for solving systems of linear equations using matrices"
This project is aimed at helping people who have not understood the topic of "Matrices" and do not understand how to solve problems using matrices.
The project also has a solution of systems using the Kramer method:

There is also a graph of functions for matrices of the 2nd order:

Also, all matrices are automatically saved there in an exel file:
